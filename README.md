# randomTouchGame
randomTouchGame, as suggested by its name is a game where you have to touch/click on a circle on the screen, in a limited time, to increase your score.
The game is made using Lua, with the infamous framework, LOVE2D.
The goal of the game is simple. Use your hand-eye coordination and try to click on a circle that has a random position on the screen as soon as you click on it. You will get a time of 10 seconds to know how much you can score. 
It's a good time-pass and you can also play it with a friend, again, to pass time. 

You will have to restart the game to play it again though. Will fix this soon.

An executable file for windows along with a .love file is provided. The source code can be checked out in the "Source Code" folder. Will update the repo to contain executable files for Linux and MacOS soon.
